This repository contains code that will introduce you to Streamlit and also how you can use 
it to monitor your infrastructure. It is split in two parts:

* [Introduction](INTRODUCTION.md): What is Streamlit, what it can do with code for 2 fun and easy to code applications. You will also learn how to deploy your application using a Podman container.
* [Monitoring](MONITORING.md): An application that connects to a Prometheus datasource and shows you metrics on real time.
